Introduction: Why Graphql?
  Using rest apis will make your application grow as you will need a lot of end points to fetch different data of same item
  Code slows down and you will write more code to manage filtering data contents, for example using query parameters

GraphQL
  A query language for APIs, we can make only POST request where in we have to pass a query mandatorily.

Type Definitions
  Query
  Mutations
  Subscriptions

Resolvers:
  Controllers for the graphql queries that help us fetch the data we need. Basically kinda following the MVC pattern.

Install express and body parser
        npm install --save express body-parser
    Please note that am not using body-parser instead i do this,
        app.use(express.json());

    npm install --save graphql
       -> help is write graphql schemas , parse and use schema with express-graphql
    npm install --save express-graphql

Express-graphql
    Exports a middleware that you can use to mount the graphwl api server.

    mutation {
        createEvent (eventInput: {

            price:45.0
            date: "2019-07-30T07:41:35.242Z"
        }) {
            title
            date
